This is **Pystronauts**, a learning tool developed for K-12 students who are interested in learning the Python programming language. Pystronauts was initially
developed as a tech demo at Georgia Tech Research Institute. As of 7/20/23, this is a WIP.


Pystronauts is locally hosted on your machine. In order for the webapp to function, fork the repository, and run the following command in your Command Prompt in a python enviroment.

>> pip install -r requirements.txt

Optionally, you can create and run this in a conda env. 

If the above does not work, here are the requirements:

> Flask
> MySQL Workbench
> Flask MySQL integration
> Hugging Face Transformers

**Some Notes**

Passwords and emails are stored locally on your SQL database connection. This does **not** send any user information outside of your local network.
